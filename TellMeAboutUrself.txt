Hello, I’m Amulya. I’m currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Science at R.V. College of Engineering, where I hold a CGPA of 8.7. My journey into technology started after my 10th, when I explored programming and developed a strong interest in coding. That motivated me to pursue a Diploma in Computer Science, where I graduated with a CGPA of 9.9 and ranked 29th in DCET to secure admission into RVCE.

Alongside academics, I’ve gained hands-on experience through two internships—one at Bock where I worked on a cloud-based file management system using ReactJS and Firebase, and another at BSQ Technology, where I contributed to a property selling application using ReactJS, SpringBoot, and MySQL. I’ve also built projects like an AI-powered Health Assistance System and EduSpark, a mentorship hub for students.

Recently, I was honored with a Merit Award in the Enterprise Architecture Competition by The Open Group, and I’ve also actively participated in hackathons and cultural events like dance, both within and outside RVCE.

Overall, I’d describe myself as someone who enjoys solving problems through technology while balancing academics, projects, and extracurriculars, and I’m looking forward to applying my skills as a software developer.
